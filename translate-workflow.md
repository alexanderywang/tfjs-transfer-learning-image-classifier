1. test out api key hiding - .env, works

2. register with google cloud for translate api key but don't use it yet

3. create modal for prediction onClick - done but could use some refactoring
3a. make the dropdown menu more dynamic and separate component - getsupported languages with api key

3b. make translated words dynamically adjust with a useEffect and separated async api call logic

4. write debounce function/api call/dummy data
5. test out localStorage for memoizing api calls
6. look for text-to-voice functionality
